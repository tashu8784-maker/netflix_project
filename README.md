🎬 Netflix Content Analysis using Python 🍿

I recently completed a data analysis project on the Netflix dataset, exploring how the platform’s content has evolved over time.

This project aimed to uncover insights such as:
🔹 Distribution between Movies and TV Shows
🔹 Top countries producing Netflix content
🔹 Yearly growth trend of titles added
🔹 Most popular genres on the platform 

Goal:
Analyze the Netflix dataset to gain insights into the platform’s content trends — such as movie vs. TV show distribution, top content-producing countries, release year trends, and most popular genres.

Techniques Used:

Data loading & cleaning using pandas

Handling missing values (country, cast, director, etc.)

Extracting new features like year_added and month_added

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Key Insights:
📊 Majority of Netflix content consists of movies
🌍 The United States produces the most Netflix titles
📅 Number of titles added to Netflix has increased over the years
🎬 Drama and Comedy are among the most common genres

Steps & Tools Used:
📦 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing with pandas
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis using matplotlib & seaborn
📈 Feature Engineering — extracting year & month from release dates
💡 Visualization of key trends and genre patterns

Key Learnings:
✅ Handling missing data in real-world datasets
✅ Extracting insights from categorical data
✅ Visualizing global content patterns effectively

Tech Stack:
🐍 Python | 📊 Pandas | 📉 Matplotlib | 🌈 Seaborn

This project helped me strengthen my data visualization, storytelling, and analytical thinking skills using real-world entertainment data.
